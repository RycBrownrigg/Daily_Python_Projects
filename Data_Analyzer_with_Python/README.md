# Movie IMDb Data Analyzer with Python

## _Project Level 3: Real-World_

This project is designed for learners who know Python fundamentals and are learning to build real-world programs.

## Project Description

In this project, your task is to analyze data from IMDb about movies, their genres, release years, ratings, and more. Download the movies.csv file. Here are the first few rows of that file:

## Expected Output

The goal is to visualize the movie ratings from the data given in the CSV file provided in the link above. Specifically, your program should generate a distribution of movie ratings as below:
