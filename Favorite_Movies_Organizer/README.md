# Favorite Movies Organizer

## _Project Level 1: Beginner_

This project is designed for beginner learners who are still learning and practicing Python fundamentals.

**Project Description**

Create a program that starts with a predefined list of your favorite movies. For example:
favorite_movies = ["Inception", "The Matrix", "Interstellar", "The Dark Knight"]
Place the above list in your .py script and then add some code that does the following:
1.	Adds a new movie to the list (e.g., “Godfather”).
2.	Removes a specific movie from the list (e.g., “The Matrix”).
3.	Prints out the total number of movies in the list.
4.	Prints out the movies in alphabetical order.
Here is how the output would look like after running the program:

Learning Benefits
